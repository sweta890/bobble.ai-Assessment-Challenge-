# bobble.ai-Assessment-Challenge-
Assessment Challenge 2020-2021( C++ Assignment)

## About the assignment
The assignment had two problem statements, and both of the problems were related to trie data structure. The assignement solution had to be written in C++.

# Problem 1: Find the Word
 Parse a dictionary (in CSV format) which contains words along with their occurrence frequencies. This trie data structure's object instance should be serialized so that later search operations can be directly performed on this trie data structure rather than building it again and again from the original CSV file.

# Problem 2: Reverse Search
dictionary of words is given, with all the words indexed from 0 to `N` (where `N` is the total number of words present in the dictionary). Store these words in a trie data structure so that a search operation can be performed on the index which will return the actual word itself.

## To run the code use c++11.
Step 1: Clone the repository.
Step 2: Make sure g++ is installed in system.
Step 3: With the help of terminal go to directory folder which you have cloned.
step 4: Type this code to compile Find the Word program.
```shell
g++ Find_the_Word
```
step 5: Type this code to compile Reverse Search program.
```shell
g++ Reverse_Search
```
step 6: To run the code type this
```shell
.\a.exe
```
